This repository make availble the PyPAD toolkit for evaluated a Preseetation Attack Detection for ID Cards based on the paper: "Improving Presentation Attack Detection for ID-Cards on Remote Verification System" Sebastian Gonzalez and Juan Tapia (Under revision)


# Abstract
This paper developed an end-to-end Presentation Attack Detection system for a remote biometric ID Cards system based on MobileNetV2 and an updated concatenate approach applied to Chilean ID Cards. Several composite scenarios based on cropped and splice areas and different capture sources are
used, including bona fide and presentation attacks species such as printed, display, composite, plastic (PVC), and synthetic ID card
images. This proposal was developed using a database consisting of 190.000 real case images with the support of a third-party
company. Also, a new framework called PyPAD used to estimate multi-class metrics compliant with the ISO/IEC 30107-3 standard
was developed and will be made available for research purposes. Our method was trained on the source and border convolutional
neural networks separately. Border can reach BPCER100 1.69%, and Source reached 2.36% BPCER100 on ID Cards attacks. A two-stage concatenate model attack using a border and source networks together can reach 0.92% of BPCER100
